"""`cp spine-recover` — re-home a project's legacy spine elements into the
current capture-loop authored format under the canonical code.

Background: a project whose `spine_substance` rows are split across two
project_codes (the cp spine-migrate slug-drift) has its real memory stranded in
legacy capitalized-layer disk files. This recovers them via the shipped write
engine. See docs/plans/2026-06-19-spine-code-drift-recovery-design.md.
